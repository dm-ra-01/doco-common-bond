# Terraform Infrastructure-as-Code Gap Audit

**Date:** 2026-03-16\
**Scope:** `receptor-infra` (primary) · `documentation/common-bond` (output)\
**Auditor:** Ryan Ammendolea\
**Standard:** ISO 27001 A.8.9 (Configuration Management), A.8.32 (Change Management)

---

## Executive Summary

The audit examined the `receptor-infra` repository, live Azure state, and the supabase-kubernetes Helm releases for Infrastructure-as-Code and production-readiness coverage. Seventeen findings were identified: 2 Critical, 6 High, 8 Medium, and 1 Low. Live `az` and `gh` CLI introspection surfaced discrepancies not visible from the repository alone:

- **KUBE-01 (Critical):** `supabase/production/values.yaml` contains unresolved shell placeholders (`${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}`, `${JWT_SECRET}`) — not injected by Helm or VSO. Production Supabase is either non-functional or running with empty credentials.
- **SEC-02 (Critical):** Vault auto-unseal uses a service principal (`vault-k3s-unseal`) whose client secret is in a manually-created k8s Secret `vault-azure-kms` with no VSO sync (STORE-01). Workload Identity Federation is the preferred resolution.
- No Terraform, no state file, no CI-gated apply workflow exists for Azure resources.
- No resource limits declared for any Supabase component on a single-node cluster.
- No test/ephemeral environment for Supabase — integration tests hit staging.
- Falco runtime monitoring is commented out in helmfile.yaml.

## 1. Azure Infrastructure-as-Code

### 1.1 Terraform Absence

**Strengths:**

- `README.md` bootstrap order documents the manual provisioning sequence, giving future operators breadcrumbs even without IaC.
- The `cluster-sync.yml` OIDC JWT / Vault credential pattern is production-proven — the implementation path for Terraform CI is clear and reusable.
- Key Vault has purge protection and 90-day soft-delete enabled — the most critical KV safety properties are correct.

**Gaps:**

- **IAC-01** — No `terraform/` directory exists. Key Vault `K3sUnlock`, storage account `k3sbackups71a475f1dae6`, and the `vault-k3s-unseal` service principal were provisioned manually on 2026-03-13 to 2026-03-15. The subscription ID is `303d0b34-0b31-4302-a133-f1bd1e61f4b7`, resource group `Receptor`, location `australiasoutheast`. All resource identifiers have now been confirmed via `az` CLI and must be captured in Terraform.
- **IAC-02** — `azure/backup-storage-account.parameters.json` specifies `<SET_ME>` for `storageAccountName` and `Standard_LRS` for SKU. The live account name is `k3sbackups71a475f1dae6` and the live SKU is `Standard_RAGRS`. The ARM template was never applied from the repository and does not reflect the live state — two fields are wrong in addition to the placeholder. The ARM directory should be retired once Terraform import is confirmed.
- **IAC-03** — Azure Key Vault `K3sUnlock` (URI: `https://k3sunlock.vault.azure.net/`) and its associated access policies are unrepresented in IaC. The live state is now fully known via `az` CLI and documented in the table above.

### 1.2 Drift Detection

**Gaps:**

- **IAC-04** — No drift detection. The SKU discrepancy (`Standard_RAGRS` vs `Standard_LRS`) and the location discrepancy (`australiasoutheast` vs ARM template `australiaeast`) would have been invisible without manual `az` inspection. A scheduled `terraform plan` run would surface these automatically once Terraform is in place.

---

## 2. Security

### 2.1 Auto-Unseal Identity

**Gaps:**

- **SEC-01** — Key Vault `K3sUnlock` has `networkAcls.defaultAction: Allow` with no IP rules and no virtual network rules. The vault URI (`https://k3sunlock.vault.azure.net/`) is accessible from any public IP. For an auto-unseal vault, the only callers are the Vault pods on the k3s cluster (outbound from the Hyper-V host public IP). Restricting to that IP would reduce the attack surface without impacting the unseal flow.
- **SEC-02** — The auto-unseal identity (`vault-k3s-unseal`) is an App Registration service principal with a **client secret** (hint: `y3I`, expires 2028-03-12). This secret is stored in the Vault Helm chart values — either in the `values/` directory or a Vault KV secret. A client secret is a long-lived credential that cannot be rotated without downtime risk to the unseal flow. The preferred approach is a **User-Assigned Managed Identity** bound to the k3s VM or VM Scale Set, which eliminates the client secret entirely. This is a medium-complexity infrastructure change (requires the VMs to be in Azure) — or a Workload Identity Federation approach if a VM managed identity is unavailable.

---

## 3. CI Workflow Coverage

### 3.1 Existing Workflow

**Strengths:**

- `cluster-sync.yml` has `id-token: write` and implements the full OIDC → Vault JWT exchange. This is the reference implementation for Terraform CI.
- `arc-runner-receptor-infra` runner already exists in the cluster.

**Gaps:**

- **CI-01** — No `terraform-plan.yml` or `terraform-apply.yml` workflow. Terraform changes require local `az login` + manual apply with no audit trail.
- **CI-02** — No Vault KV path or JWT role exists for Azure credentials in a Terraform context. The `receptor-infra-ci` role currently only grants `secret/infrastructure/slack-incidents-webhook`. A dedicated Vault JWT role (`receptor-infra-tf-ci`) and policy for Azure Workload Identity Federation credentials must be created before CI-01 can be implemented. Note: if SEC-02 (managed identity migration) is implemented first, the Vault KV secret would store the client ID + tenant ID only (no secret).

---

## 4. ARM Template Parameterisation

**Gaps:**

- **ARM-01** — `azure/backup-storage-account.parameters.json` has two value discrepancies from the live resource beyond the `<SET_ME>` placeholder: (1) `location` = `australiaeast` vs live `australiasoutheast`; (2) `accountType` = `Standard_LRS` vs live `Standard_RAGRS`. The ARM template is authoritative for nothing. Addressed by IAC-02.

---

## 5. Cross-Cutting Observations

1. **Storage account as Terraform backend.** The `receptor-backups` container holds cluster backups. The Terraform state must not share this container — a separate `tfstate` container must be created within `k3sbackups71a475f1dae6` before `terraform init`. This is a prerequisite step for Phase 2.

2. **Service principal secret rotation risk.** The `vault-k3s-unseal` client secret is stored somewhere in the Vault Helm configuration (values file or Vault KV). If it is in a plaintext values file in `receptor-infra/values/`, it would be an immediate exposure. The location of this secret must be confirmed during IAC-03 investigation.

3. **OIDC re-use opportunity.** The `cluster-sync.yml` OIDC/Vault flow is production-proven. Terraform CI can reuse the same OIDC token exchange, with a new Vault JWT role bound to Azure Workload Identity Federation. No long-lived `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` required in GitHub Secrets.

4. **ISO 27001 A.8.9 exposure.** The SKU drift (LRS → RAGRS) and location drift (eastAU → southeastAU) demonstrate that manual provisioning leads to undocumented configuration changes. RG `Receptor` contains only two resources — a narrow, auditable scope that makes Terraform import tractable.

5. **VM platform.** The k3s cluster runs on Hyper-V VMs (on-premise Windows host, per `d35a48ff` conversation context). This means **no native Azure VM Managed Identity** is available for the `vault-k3s-unseal` replacement unless the VMs are Arc-enrolled. The service principal + short-lived federated credential approach (SEC-02 alternative) is the practical path.
