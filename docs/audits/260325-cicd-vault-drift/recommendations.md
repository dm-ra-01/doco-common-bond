## Agent Clarifications (Human-Approved)

| Item | Decision |
| :--- | :------- |
| Vault access for live verification | kubectl exec into vault-0 pod is the only way to run vault commands. Listing JWT roles requires a root or privileged token (403 without auth). Live verification requires generating a root token via 3-of-5 recovery key shares. |
| vault-action path format | The correct pattern for hashicorp/vault-action@v3 with KV-v2 is logical path (secret/infrastructure/...) with kv-version: 2. The action internally appends /data/. Using secret/data/... without kv-version may produce double /data/data/ depending on auto-detection. |
| Agentic PE reference | The Microsoft GBB 'Agentic Platform Engineering' framework (cluster-doctor pattern, crawl-walk-run) is the reference architecture for the proposed overhaul. See https://github.com/microsoftgbb/agentic-platform-engineering |
| vault-action path format — verified | Both formats work: (1) secret/data/infrastructure/... WITHOUT kv-version passes path as-is to API — correct. (2) secret/infrastructure/... WITH kv-version: 2 — action internally appends /data/ — also correct. Error was using /data/ path WITH kv-version: 2 producing double /data/data/. Policies are written against REST API paths (secret/data/...). |
| Live Vault state verified | Live Vault interrogated 2026-03-25 using scoped write token. All roles, policies, secrets, and mounts catalogued. Replaces all prior speculation about Vault state. |

## 🔴 Critical

### VD-08: The ecosystem has no agent-readable infrastructure contracts. Vault roles, policies, and secret paths exist only on the 

Affects: `all-repos` — Agentic operability


- [x] Implement the 'Crawl' tier of agentic platform engineering: codify all Vault roles, policies, and secret contracts as declarative files in receptor-infra. Tasks VD-01-T1, VD-02-T2, VD-03-T1 are prerequisites.

      _(Completed: 2026-03-25T00:40:13Z)_
- [ ] Create .agents/infrastructure-contracts.md in receptor-infra — a single document that agents can read to understand the mapping between workflows (role, path, audience) and Vault configuration.

- [x] Create vault/bootstrap-jwt-roles.sh — an idempotent script that reads vault/roles/*.yaml and vault/policies/*.hcl and applies them to Vault. Must accept a VAULT_TOKEN parameter.

Affects: `all-deploy-repos` — vault-action configuration


- [x] Standardise all 5 deploy workflows to use the logical path format (secret/infrastructure/...) with explicit kv-version: 2. This is the correct pattern per hashicorp/vault-action@v3 documentation.

### VD-06: The deploy workflow YAML is copy-pasted across 5 repositories with no shared reusable workflow. Each copy drifts indepen

Affects: `all-deploy-repos` — Workflow duplication


- [ ] Create a reusable workflow in receptor-infra (.github/workflows/deploy-gitops.yml) parameterised by app-name, image-repo, and manifest-path. All 5 repos call this via workflow_call.
      `/Users/ryan/development/common_bond/antigravity-environment/receptor-infra/.github/workflows/deploy-gitops.yml`
- [ ] Refactor all 5 deploy.yml files to call the reusable workflow instead of inlining the Vault + token + manifest update steps.
      `ALL — deploy.yml in all 5 repos (refactor to call reusable workflow)`

Affects: `common-bond` — Audit regression


- [ ] Add a 'prerequisite infrastructure' section to the audit-document-standards skill: any finding that requires infrastructure provisioning (Vault roles, k8s CRDs, DNS records) must include a verification command in the task definition.
      `/Users/ryan/development/common_bond/antigravity-environment/dev-environment/.agents/skills/audit-document-standards/SKILL.md`

Affects: `receptor-infra` — Vault policies


- [x] Fix ci-supabase-receptor policy: change 'infrastructure/data/supabase*' paths to 'secret/data/supabase/*' paths to match the actual KV mount.

- [x] Update all 4 remaining deploy workflows to fetch app_id from Vault instead of GitHub Secrets, matching the preferencer-frontend pattern.

### VD-07: supabase status -o env output parsed with grep '^ANON_KEY=' fails when output contains ANSI codes, leading whitespace, o

Affects: `planner-frontend` — Supabase readiness


- [ ] Create a shared supabase-start composite action (or reusable script) that handles DinD readiness, supabase start, status polling with robust key extraction (strip ANSI, handle stderr), and GITHUB_ENV export. Use in all frontend CI workflows.

### VD-09: No pre-flight check validates a workflow's vault-action role, secrets path, and audience against documented Vault config

Affects: `all-deploy-repos` — CI contract validation


- [ ] Add a CI job in receptor-infra that scans org-wide deploy.yml files and validates vault-action parameters against vault/roles/ and vault/policies/ definitions. Depends on VD-01-T1 and VD-02-T2.

## Implementation Order

| Phase | Finding IDs | Rationale |
| :---- | :---------- | :-------- |
| 1 | VD-01, VD-04, VD-11 | VD-01 creates the one missing JWT role, VD-04 standardises the path format, VD-11 fixes the broken supabase-receptor policy. All are direct blockers of CI. |
| 2 | VD-02, VD-05, VD-07 | Once deployments work, document the secret inventory, unify app_id source, and fix supabase readiness detection. |
| 3 | VD-03, VD-08 | Prevents future drift by making Vault configuration version-controlled and agent-readable. |
| 4 | VD-06, VD-09, VD-10 | Structural prevention: shared workflows eliminate copy-paste drift, CI contract validation catches errors before runtime, and hardened DoD prevents future audit regressions. |
