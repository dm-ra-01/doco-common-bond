# 🎨 Brand Architecture

*Unified vision. Specialized products. Distinct identities.*

Common Bond operates under a **"House of Brands"** strategy, maintaining a clear distinction between our corporate parent identity and our specialized product suite, Receptor.

## The Identity Split

We maintain two distinct visual languages to serve different stakeholders and environments.

| Identity | Focus | Primary Palette | Key Typeface |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **[Common Bond](./common-bond)** | Corporate / Investor | Teal & Slate | Montserrat |
| **[Receptor Suite](./receptor-suite)** | Product / Clinical | Indigo & Slate | Inter |
