# Strategic Partnerships & Ecosystem

Receptor will not operate in isolation. Long-term success depends on deep integrations and collaborative relationships across the Australian medical education ecosystem. The following partnerships represent **future strategic objectives**, not current arrangements.

---

## 1. Technical Integration Partners (Future — FY2028+)

### A. Rostering Software Vendors

**Target timeframe:** FY2029+

We intend to partner with major providers (e.g., Allocate/HealthRoster, Kronos) to enable outputs from the Receptor Matching Engine to flow directly into live rosters. This integration is a long-term objective (approximately 3+ years), allowing us to focus on core allocation functionality first.

### B. Human Resource Management Information System (HRMIS) Connectivity

**Target timeframe:** FY2028+

Bi-directional synchronisation with state-level HR systems (e.g., SA Health Oracle, WA Health HRMIS) would maintain a "Single Source of Truth" for worker credentials and employment status.

---

## 2. Professional & Academic Alliances (Future)

### A. Specialist Colleges

We plan to align rotation tracking with the training requirements of colleges such as the Royal Australasian College of Physicians (RACP) and the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons (RACS), facilitating smoother transitions from prevocational training to Registrar positions.

### B. University Research Partnerships

We intend to collaborate with Health Informatics departments to publish anonymised research on workforce distribution efficiency and its impact on junior doctor wellbeing.

---

## 3. Advocacy Partners (Future)

- **Australian Medical Association (AMA):** We plan regular consultation to ensure the platform remains "Doctor-Centric" and protects the interests of junior medical staff.
- **State JMO Forums:** We aim to provide a direct channel for primary users to influence the platform's development roadmap.
