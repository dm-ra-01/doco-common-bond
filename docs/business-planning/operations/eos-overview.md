# Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS)

Receptor uses the **Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS)** to maintain focus, discipline, and accountability as we scale from a "Doctor-Developer" project to a nationwide healthcare infrastructure platform.

## The Six Key Components

EOS is built on strengthening six core areas of the business:

## EOS in a Hybrid Model

For a Hybrid SaaS + Consulting business, EOS helps us balance two different operating speeds:
*   **Consulting Velocity:** Rapid, project-based work with immediate feedback.
*   **SaaS Velocity:** Long-term, architectural builds focused on scalability.

By using EOS, we ensure that the lessons from consulting (Issues) are documented (Process) and prioritized for development (Rocks).
