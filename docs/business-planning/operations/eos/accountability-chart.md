# Accountability Chart

In EOS, we focus on the **Accountability Chart** rather than a traditional Organizational Chart. We define the "Seats" first based on what the business needs to achieve its V/TO, then find the right people for them.

Each seat holder is evaluated on **GWC**:
- **G**et it: Do they fundamentally understand the seat?
- **W**ant it: Do they have the fire and desire to do it?
- **C**apacity: Do they have the time, mental, and physical resources to excel?
