# EOS Core Processes

The "Receptor Way" is a repeatable model for delivering workforce intelligence. By documenting these core processes, we ensure scalability and consistency as we move from founder-led engagements to standardized SaaS delivery.

## 1. Technical Operations (The "Safe & Scalable" Model)

Our technical processes are designed to meet the high data sovereignty and security requirements of Australian healthcare.

### The Professional Service Tiers

| Tier | Process | Strategic Value |
|------|---------|----------------|
| **Phase 1** | **Allocation Audit:** Independent review of a health service's current manual logic. | Proves the need for the SaaS tool by exposing risks. |
| **Phase 2** | **Constraint Mapping:** Translating clinical SOPs into mathematical constraints. | Embeds Receptor into the core institutional workflow. |
| **Phase 3** | **Matcher Run:** Collecting preferences and executing the optimization. | Delivers the "Receipt of Fairness" to the workforce. |

## 3. High-Fidelity Design Standards

Receptor is the "face" of the medical technology suite. Our design process prioritizes high-fidelity, professional aesthetics to build institutional trust.

- **Human-First UI:** Focus on reducing "Matching Anxiety" for doctors.
- **Enterprise-Grade Styling:** Using professional typography (Outfit) and a refined color palette.
- **Micro-Interactions:** Smooth transitions that make complex data sets feel approachable.
