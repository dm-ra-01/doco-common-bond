# Operating Rhythms: The Company Heartbeat

To maintain alignment without drowning in meetings, we adhere to a specific cadence of "Rituals." These rhythms ensure everyone knows *what* to do and *why* it matters.

## The Cadence

| Frequency | Ritual | Format | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Quarterly** | **Strategy & OKR Reset** | Long-form | Review past quarter's performance. Set 3-5 high-level Objectives and Key Results for the next 90 days. |
| **Fortnightly** | **OKR Check-in** | Teams Meeting (30-60m) | Review progress on Key Results (Green/Yellow/Red). Identify blockers. Adjust tactics for the week. |
| **Weekly** | **Async Standup** | Chat / Slack | Quick bullets: "What I did yesterday, What I'm doing today, Blockers." |
| **Ad-Hoc** | **Problem Solving** | Teams Meeting | Focused deep-dives on specific technical or strategic hurdles. "No agenda, no meeting." |

## Tools of the Trade
*   **Chat (Slack/Teams):** For "pulse" communication, quick questions, and social glue.
*   **Video (Teams):** For high-bandwidth discussions and the Weekly Check-in.
*   **Task Board (GitHub/Linear):** The single source of truth for *work to be done*.

## The Weekly Check-in Agenda
1.  **Scoreboard:** Review the Key Results. Are we on track?
2.  **Customer/User Feedback:** What have we heard from the field?
3.  **Blockers:** Who needs help?
4.  **Priorities:** What is the "One Thing" for each person this week?
