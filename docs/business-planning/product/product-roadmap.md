# Product Roadmap & Future Capabilities

Receptor is evolving from a rotation matching tool into a comprehensive medical workforce management ecosystem. This roadmap outlines our planned feature trajectory.

For a complete view of all current and planned services with value propositions, see the [Service Catalog](./service-catalog). This roadmap shows the *timeline* for capability development; the Service Catalog provides the *business value* for each capability.
:::

## Phase 1: Core Excellence (Current — FY2026–27)

- **Rotation Matching Engine:** Automated preference-based allocation for prevocational trainees (Interns, RMOs, HMOs), vocational trainees (Registrars), and unaccredited registrars.
- **Local Hospital Network (LHN) Portal:** Dashboard for Medical Workforce Managers to track allocations across training cohorts.
- **Self-Hosted Supabase:** Robust data infrastructure with Row Level Security (RLS).

## Phase 2: Intelligence & Integration (FY2027–28)

- **AI-Optimised Allocation:** Machine learning models to predict 'bottleneck' rotations and suggest optimisations based on historical preference trends.
- **Rotation Operations:** Porting rotation swap logic and automated Certificates of Service generation from legacy prototypes to the Next.js suite.
- **National ePortfolio Sync:** API integration with Clinical Learning Australia (CLA) for automatic Entrustable Professional Activity (EPA) credentialling.

## Phase 3: Mobile & Ecosystem (FY2028–29)

- **Native Mobile App (Flutter):** A dedicated trainee app for preference submission, rotation viewing, and the 'Rural Swing' move-in guide.
- **Professional Development Marketplace:** Integration of accredited CPD modules tailored to specific rotation types.
- **Interstate Workforce Portability:** Unified profile system for trainees moving between Victoria, SA, and WA.

## Phase 4: Rostering Integration (FY2029+)

- **Rostering Software Integration:** Outputs from the Receptor Matching Engine flow directly into live rosters via partnerships with providers such as Allocate/HealthRoster and Kronos.
- **Fatigue Monitoring API:** Integration with rostering software to provide real-time fatigue risk assessments.

## Strategic Vision

> "To be the national standard for medical workforce planning in Australia, ensuring every trainee—from Intern to Registrar—is placed in a role that maximises their training potential while meeting Health Service requirements."
