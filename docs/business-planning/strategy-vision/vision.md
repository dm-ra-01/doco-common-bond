# Vision

**Standardising Fairness in Medical Workforce Allocation.**

## The Problem

Hospital medical rosters are built on a foundation of "rotations"—fixed blocks of clinical experience that rotate throughout the year. The process of assigning hundreds (and for some services, thousands) of doctors to these blocks is currently:

*   **Inefficient:** Manual, spreadsheet-based processes consume thousands of administrative hours every season. Workforce teams are bogged down in logic that should be automated.
*   **Opaque:** Doctors don't understand *why* they received certain rotations. This lack of transparency leads to perceived bias, dissatisfaction, and ultimately, attrition.
*   **High-Risk:** Errors in manual logic lead to accreditation failures for training programs and critical workforce gaps on the front line.

## The Solution

Receptor provides the **intelligent matching engine** that replaces manual placement with an auditable, preference-driven algorithm. 

We don't just build a roster; we architect the optimal workforce distribution for the entire clinical year. By resolving complex constraints (site parity, training requirements, leave cover) against doctor preferences, we deliver a "Win-Win" for both the administration and the clinician.

### The Complete Rotation Lifecycle

Receptor manages the **full rotation lifecycle** from planning through completion:

1. **Position Management** — Master data for teams, locations, and positions
2. **Job Line Planning** — Rotation configuration with AMC compliance validation
3. **Preferencing** — Transparent, mobile-first preference submission
4. **Matching** — Optimal allocation via constraint-driven algorithm
5. **Rotation Operations** — Swap management, term tracking, and Certificates of Service
6. **Rostering Handoff** — Integration with downstream shift scheduling systems

:::note Scope Boundary
**Recruitment and onboarding are out of scope.** Receptor begins where onboarding ends—workers must be credentialed and contracted before entering the allocation workflow.

## The Future: Scaling the Match

Receptor is built to become the default infrastructure for all healthcare trainee allocations in Australia. Our mission extends beyond Junior Medical Officers (JMOs):

    Expanding to ACEM, RACP, and RACS where training requirements (Rural, Trauma, ICU) are exponentially more complex.

**The Goal:** To ensure every healthcare professional in Australia receives a "Receipt of Fairness" for their rotation allocation.
