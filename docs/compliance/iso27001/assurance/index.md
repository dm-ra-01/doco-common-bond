# Assurance

Assurance is about proving that our system works. It involves checking our own homework (Internal Audit) and fixing mistakes when we find them (Corrective Actions).

## Key Procedures

- **[Internal Audit](./internal-audit.md)**: How we verify our own compliance.
- **[Non-Conformity Log](./nonconformity-log.md)**: Where we track failures and issues.
- **[Corrective Actions](./corrective-actions.md)**: How we fix the root cause of issues.
