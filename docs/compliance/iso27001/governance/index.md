# Governance

Governance sets the strategic direction for information security at Common Bond. It defines **why** we do security, **who** is responsible, and the **boundaries** of our efforts.

## Key Documents

- **[ISMS Scope](./scope.md)**: Defines the boundaries of our security management system.
- **[Objectives](./objectives.md)**: Our security goals aligned with business strategy.
- **[Roles & Responsibilities](./roles-responsibilities.md)**: Who is accountable for what.
