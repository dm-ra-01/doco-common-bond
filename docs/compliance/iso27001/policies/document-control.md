# Document Control Policy

## 1. Purpose
To ensure that all documents within the ISMS are adequately controlled, approved, and available to those who need them.

## 2. Policy
We use **Git (GitHub)** and this **Docusaurus** site as our primary document control system.

### 2.1 Creation and Update
- All ISMS documents are Markdown files stored in the `antigravity-environment` repository.
- Changes are proposed via **Pull Requests (PRs)**.
- PRs for ISMS documents require review and approval by the Information Security Manager (or delegate).

### 2.2 Version Control
- Git provide a complete audit trail of all changes (who, what, when).
- The `main` branch represents the current approved version of the ISMS.

### 2.3 Review
- Documents are reviewed at least **annually** or upon significant changes to the organization or threat landscape.
- Obsolete documents are either archived (via Git history) or deleted to prevent unintended use.

### 2.4 External Documents
External documents (e.g., ISO standards, laws, customer contracts) are identified and controlled by the CTO.
