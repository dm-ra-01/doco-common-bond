# Risk Management

We take a pragmatic, risk-based approach to security. We don't implement controls for the sake of it; we implement them to reduce specific risks to our business and customers.

## Key Documents

- **[Risk Methodology](./methodology.md)**: How we measure risk (Likelihood x Impact).
- **[Risk Register](./risk-register.md)**: Our active list of identified risks and their status.
- **[Treatment Plan](./treatment-plan.md)**: The specific actions we are taking to fix high-priority risks.
