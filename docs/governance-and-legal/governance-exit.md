# Governance & Exit/Succession Planning

Long-term governance ensures Receptor remains a stable, trusted infrastructure partner for the Australian health system.

## 1. Corporate Governance
- **Advisory Board:** Composition including a mix of Senior Clinicians, Health Executives, and Data Ethics experts.
- **Regular Audits:** Bi-annual independent security and clinical safety audits.

## 2. Succession Planning
- **The "Key Man" Risk Mitigation:** All critical rotation logic and infrastructure processes are documented (refer to the **Technical Documentation** section).
- **Leadership Bench:** Identifying and mentoring "Clinical Product Leads" within the organization to succeed current founders.

## 3. Long-term Exit Strategy
Receptor’s priority is system stability, not a quick flip.
- **Option A: Public Benefit Corporation (PBC):** Transitioning to a model that enshrines "Junior Doctor Wellbeing" in the company charter.
- **Option B: Strategic Government Acquisition:** Becoming a sovereign-owned piece of national medical infrastructure.
- **Option C: Specialist Tech Acquisition:** Integration with a global leader in clinical workforce management (e.g., Allocate Software) only if clinical ethics are preserved.
