# Decision Rights: The "Small Team" Model

For a streamlined, 3-person founding team, complex governance frameworks (like extensive committees or voting blocs) are bureaucratic dead weight. Instead, we operate on **High-Trust Agility**.

## The Core Philosophy
**"Disagree and Commit."**
We encourage rigorous debate on technical and strategic choices. Once a decision is made, everyone commits to the execution as if it were their own idea.

## Decision Categories

### 1. Strategic & Existential (Founder Lead)
**Owner:** Founder/CEO
**Scope:**
*   Company vision and "North Star" metrics.
*   Capital allocation and runway management.
*   Go/No-Go on major partnerships or pivots.
*   Final veto on "Type 1" (Irreversible) decisions.

### 2. Product & Technical (Engineering Lead)
**Owner:** Technical Lead / Engineers
**Scope:**
*   Architecture and stack selection (within strategic constraints).
*   Code quality standards and implementation details.
*   Tooling and infrastructure choices.

### 3. Operational & Tactics (Collaborative)
**Owner:** Team (Consensus)
**Scope:**
*   Sprint planning and weekly goals (OKRs).
*   Marketing copy and design iterations.
*   Customer support responses.

## Conflict Resolution
If the team is deadlocked on a decision:
1.  **Revisit the Data:** Is there objective evidence we are ignoring?
2.  **Revisit the Values:** Which option aligns best with our [Core Values](../strategy/strategy-vision/core-values)?
3.  **Founder Tie-Breaker:** The Founder/CEO makes the final call to unblock progress.
