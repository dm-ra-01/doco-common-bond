# Ethics & AI Governance Framework

As Receptor introduces automated and AI-enhanced allocation logic, we must adhere to the highest ethical standards to ensure fairness and transparency in medical careers.

## 1. Core Ethical Principles

- **Fairness:** The algorithm must be audited regularly to ensure no systematic bias against specific demographics or graduate categories.
- **Transparency:** JMOs must have access to the "Logic of Allocation"—an explanation of why they were placed in a specific rotation.
- **Human-in-the-Loop:** Final allocation decisions must always be reviewable and overridable by a qualified Workforce Manager.

## 2. AI Governance Controls

### A. Algorithmic Impact Assessments
Annual reviews of the matching engine’s outcomes to identify and mitigate unintended consequences (e.g., disproportionate rural placement).

### B. Data Ethics
- **Consent:** Clear communication to JMOs on how their preference data is used for both their own allocation and system-wide optimization.
- **Security:** Strict adherence to RLS and data de-identification for any research-based AI training.

## 3. Compliance Alignment
Aligining with the **Australian Government's AI Ethics Framework**, specifically focusing on "Reliability and Safety" in a clinical workforce context.
