# Cooperative Environment

Receptor does not exist in a vacuum. We thrive by actively managing our "Cooperative Environment"—the ecosystem of partners, vendors, regulators, and developers that surrounds us.

## 1. Structural Partners
These are the entities that define the playing field.
*   **Australian Medical Council (AMC):** We align strictly with AMC frameworks (National Common Framework) to ensure our software is compliant-by-design.
*   **Health Services (Hospitals):** Our primary customers and design partners. We rely on deep, trust-based relationships with Medical Workforce Units (MWUs).

## 2. Technology Vendors
We stand on the shoulders of giants to deliver enterprise-grade reliability with a small team.
*   **Supabase:** The backend "brain" (Postgres, Auth, Realtime).
*   **Cloudflare:** Frontend delivery and edge network.
*   **AWS/Self-Hosted:** Core infrastructure and compute.
*   **Open Source ML Models:** Advanced machine learning models for the Allocator engine.

## 3. Developer & Information Community
We believe in "working in public" where appropriate to build authority and trust.
*   **Open Documentation:** This site is a testament to our intra-organisational transparency.
*   **Standards Bodies:** actively participating in discussions around data interchange standards (HL7/FHIR) where relevant for workforce data.

**Strategic Note:** We view our Cooperative Environment as a moat. By integrating deeply with both the *technological* best-in-class solutions and the *regulatory* authorities (eg. AMC), we become the "bridge" that is hard to displace.
