# Customer Success & User Support

Customer Success at Receptor is measured by the reduction in "matching anxiety" for JMOs and the administrative efficiency gains for Health Services.

## 1. The Onboarding Journey

### Phase 1: Data Audit
Before a new LHN goes live, we perform a deep dive into their legacy rotation data to identify inconsistencies and mapping requirements.

### Phase 2: Configuration & Training
- **Workforce Manager Training:** Intensive workshops on allocation scenarios, weighting logic, and EPA tracking.
- **JMO Orientation:** Providing self-service guides and "How-To" videos for preference submission.

## 2. JMO Engagement & Value

- **Transparency reports:** Providing JMOs with post-match anonymized data on how preferences were satisfied across the network.
- **Feedback Loops:** Quarterly pulse checks on JMO satisfaction with the rotation planning process.

## 3. Support Infrastructure

- **Knowledge Base:** Comprehensive documentation (this portal) specifically tailored for different user roles (JMOs vs. Managers).
- **Embedded Support:** In-app chat support during critical preference windows to resolve technical hurdles in real-time.
