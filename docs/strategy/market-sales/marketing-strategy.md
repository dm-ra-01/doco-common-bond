# Marketing & Lead Generation Strategy

Receptor's marketing strategy targets Directors of Medical Services, Hospital Executives, and Medical Workforce Managers—positioning the platform as the definitive solution for rotation allocation fairness in Australian Health Services.

## 1. Brand Positioning

### Value Pillars

| Pillar | Message | Target Audience |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| **Workforce Retention Assurance** | "De-risk your workforce planning—place trainees where they want to be" | Directors of Medical Services, Executives |
| **Transparency ("The Glass Box")** | "Every allocation decision is explainable and auditable" | Medical Workforce Managers, JMOs |
| **Employer of Choice** | "Demonstrate commitment to fair, preference-driven placement" | HR Directors, Recruitment Teams |

### Brand Identity

- **Doctor-Built Platform:** Receptor is founded and built by a Doctor-Developer—a practising clinician with software engineering expertise. This delivers clinical credibility and technical velocity.
- **Allocation Specialist:** We are not a rostering system. We create the compliant rotation matrix that feeds daily rostering tools like Allocate/HealthRoster.
- **Australian Focus:** Purpose-built for Australian rotation rules, training requirements, and state-based constraints.

## 2. Lead Generation Channels

### A. Executive & Board-Level Engagement

- **Whitepaper Series:** Publishing data-driven reports on JMO retention, workforce satisfaction metrics, and allocation efficiency.
- **Direct Outreach:** Targeted engagement with Directors of Medical Services and Hospital CEOs via LinkedIn and industry networks.

### B. Doctor-Developer Advantage (Founder-Led)

The founder's dual expertise as a clinician and developer enables direct peer engagement:

- **Clinical Credibility:** Conversations with DCTs and Medical Directors as a clinical peer, not a vendor
- **Conference Speaking:** Presenting at Medical Education and Health Informatics conferences (AIDH, PMCV Annual Symposium)
- **JMO Forum Partnerships:** Engaging state-wide JMO forums to build grassroots demand

#### Established Project Track Record

The founder's credibility is further strengthened by **demonstrated experience on real workforce projects**:

- **AMC Clinical Experience Category Adaptation:** Hands-on involvement in adapting rotations to updated AMC requirements
- **Five-to-Four Term Rotation Transition:** Participation in restructuring annual rotation cycles
- **Job Line Planning & Preferencing:** Direct experience designing allocation workflows

These projects provide authentic talking points and potential case study material. See [Strategic Advantage](../../operations/eos/vto#competitive-strengths-the-how-we-win) for full details.

### C. Clinical Advisory Program

Formal engagement with Directors of Clinical Training (DCTs) as brand ambassadors and product advisors.
