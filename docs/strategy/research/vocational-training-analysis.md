# Vocational Training Market Analysis

This document provides a critical appraisal of vocational (registrar and fellowship) training specialties across Melbourne health services, identifying which programs would benefit from Receptor's preferencing and allocation service based on trainee numbers.

---

## Decision Criteria

**Threshold for Service Adoption:** ≥14 trainees/unaccredited registrars per specialty per allocation cycle

Programs with 14+ registrars face meaningful complexity in:
- Preference collection and analysis
- Rotation scheduling across multiple sites
- Conflict resolution and appeals management

---

## Understanding the Specialty Landscape

:::info Important Distinction
Many medical terms refer to **rotation terms** (what prevocational/vocational trainees rotate through), not separate **training programs**. Receptor can serve both:
1. **Vocational Training Programs** - Registrar allocation to health services (covered in this document)
2. **Rotation Terms** - Intern/PGY2/PGY3+ allocation to specific terms (covered in [Pricing Projections](../../operations/finance/pricing-projections.md))

---

## Strategic Recommendations

### 1. **Start with Existing PMCV Matches**
PMCV already coordinates several vocational matches. Demonstrating value in these could lead to broader adoption:
- RACP ATSM (Advanced Trainee Selection Matching)
- Orthopaedics Unaccredited Registrar Match
- Radiology Registrar Match
- First Year Psychiatry Training Match

### 2. **Target Emergency Medicine First**
Emergency Medicine is the "low-hanging fruit":
- Large cohorts per health service (15-30 registrars)
- Annual rotation allocation is painful
- Health services manage independently (not college-controlled)

### 3. **Basic Physician Training = Biggest Opportunity**
With 300+ trainees and complex subspecialty rotations, BPT represents the largest single revenue opportunity if positioned as a Victorian solution.

### 4. **Bundle with Prevocational**
Position vocational matching as an "add-on" to existing intern/PGY2/PGY3+ matches, offering package discounts.
