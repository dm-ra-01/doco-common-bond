## Vision Statement

> *"I've spent my career navigating both the clinical frontline and the technical backend. I've seen first-hand how opaque allocation processes erode trust and drive talented doctors out of the public system. Receptor exists to change that — to bring transparency, fairness, and intelligence to workforce management so that Health Services can become genuine employers of choice."*
